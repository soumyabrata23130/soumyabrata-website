			<p>My web development journey began in 2022 when I started learning HTML as part of the subject Modern Computer Application in Class XII. At the time, I did not know CSS, and I had to format the text with deprecated HTML tags and attributes. I started learning CSS in 2023 after the Higher Secondary Examination. I paused my web development journey in late 2023 to learn C, C++ and Python at Academy of Technology (AOT), Hooghly.</p>
			<p>I resumed my web development journey in late 2024 during my third semester. I began learning JavaScript, and I also tried to go backend with Django. While the backend worked, I realized that the backend framework is too complex. So, I moved away from backend development to focus on frontend. Even in frontend, I struggled with React, especially as the Create React App (CRA) is deprecated in favour of Next.js and Vite. I chose Next.js, but turns out it is actually a next step after React. So, I have moved away from React and Next.js for a while.</p>
			<p>Nowadays, I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwaind CSS and external APIs for web development. Once the second year is complete, I can resume my frontend learning and also take an internship in frontend development. I am also committed to backend development, but with more traditional frameworks like Express.</p>
