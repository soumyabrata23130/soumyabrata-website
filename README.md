# Soumyabrata's Website

My personal website built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It contains a portfolio to introduce myself and links to other projects and websites. Partly inspired from [Nubfolio](https://github.com/SukritDeb/nubfolio) by Sukrit Deb, it is designed to be as responsive as possible, so that it can be comfortably read in a mobile as well as in a PC.

## Known Issues
