          Hello, I'm Soumyabrata Bhattacharjee. Born in 2004, I am a computer
          science and engineering student and a tech enthusiast. Web
          development is my area of expertise. I have mastered C, Java, and
          Python programming languages, along with frontend development in
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. I have also learnt Figma to design
          complex websites before coding them. I am currently learning
          Node.js, Flask and Flutter. My goal is to complete my study in B.
