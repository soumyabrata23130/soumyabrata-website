				<h2 class="font-bold m-1 text-2xl">From Borders to Bridges: A Guide to Unlearn Hate and Embrace Brotherhood</h2>
				<p>Bardhaman (WB), 14 May 2025</p>
			</div>
			<p>I was once like many others around me — viewing neighbouring countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, and even Nepal and the Maldives through a lens of suspicion, anger, and fear. I have grown up in an environment where these countries are painted as "enemies" in conversations, textbooks, and online spaces. These are the countries we blame, mock, or even fear. I didn't know much about their people — only their politics, or what was said about them.</p>
			<p>But during the Lok Sabha election in 2024, something began to change.</p>
			<!-- echo chambers -->
			<h3 class="font-bold m-1 text-xl">The Hidden Echo Chamber I Lived In</h3>
			<p>Before the 2024 election, I lived inside an ideological echo chamber. Social media memes, fiery YouTube debates, and emotionally charged family opinions shaped how I saw the world. Pakistan? A hostile neighbour since 1947, a name that echos conflict. China? Yet another hostile neighbour, demeaning our supremacy. Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Maldives? Once India-friendly puppets, now silent rivals.</p>
			<p>And then I started listening. Really listening. Not to any government, but to people — ordinary users on social platforms, human stories buried beneath propaganda, and facts checked by independent journalists. Suddenly, the world isn't black and white. It is complicated, painful, beautiful — and most of all, human.</p>
			<!-- awakening -->
			<h3 class="font-bold m-1 text-xl">The Moment that Changed My Mindset Forever</h3>
			<p>During the 2024 Lok Sabha election, the right-wing media used to slogan "Ab Ki Baar 400 Paar", referring to the BJP's overconfidence to get more than 400 seats in the 543-seat Lok Sabha. However, after the election, the party alone got only 240 seats, far below to the 272 seats needed for majority. So, it sought help from its allies, including the "kingmakers" Janata Dal (United) (JD(U)) and Telugu Desam Party (TDP), who each got 16 and 12 seats respectively. While the BJP now has 293 seats with its allies, it is far less than the aspired 400 seats.</p>
			<p>This was the moment when I began questioning the arrogance of the BJP and the right-wing media, as it was not consistent with the reality. The BJP once welcomed the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, but the temple itself was built at the cost of destroying the local shops without compensation. The BJP, especially its Uttar Pradesh unit, introduced the model of "bulldozer justice", where houses of criminals are bulldozed, and they claim the houses were built in "illegal" or "public" lands. That's not how justice works in my country, at least in theory.</p>
			<p>I continued digging more and more claims by right-wing groups, many of which are either false or exaggerated. Another thing I see is that they target a minority group to promote their religion. I used to think the minority group was really a threat to the majority community I belong to. However, turns out only a subset of the community is against the majority, and there are many minority people that are friendly towards the majority. I also realize that religions both unite and divide people in the name of God. They unite people who follow their version of God, and call others "irreligious".</p>
			<!-- awakening 2 -->
			<h3 class="font-bold m-1 text-xl">Changing Mindset Towards Neighbours</h3>
			<p>2024 and 2025 were the years when I saw the world differently after breaking the echo chamber. Many Indians still view their neighbours through a lens of suspicion, anger, and fear. However, I have gradually challenged their views, presenting the reality of the people in those countries. None of these about rewriting history. These are about understanding it, and refusing to let it define the future forever.</p>
			<!-- Bangladesh -->
			<h4 class="font-bold m-1 text-lg">Bangladesh: Once an Enemy, Now a Source of Empathy</h4>
			<p>Bangladesh saw a mass uprising against the government in July 2024. Dubbed the "July Revolution", it overthrew the Sheikh Hasina government, which was considered India-friendly by Indian media. An interim government was under Muhammad Yunus, the chief advisor of the interim government. During his government, various right-wing media began reporting news of the minority being under attack of the majority in the country, mirroring the situation of the majority in our country being attacked by the minority.</p>
			<p>As I was still coming out of the echo chamber back then, I initially saw this incident as unfortunate for the minority. However, I eventually came to know that they are so isolated that they cannot be considered part of a covert conspiracy theory against the minority. Both the majority and the minority were suffered in the uprising. I empathize on the unfortunate lives in Bangladesh, regardless of their religion or creed.</p>
			<p>There have also been reports of Bangladeshis illegally entering India for asylum. I found that such claim dates all the way back to the formation of Bangladesh in 1971. While no reliable data exist on how many Bangladeshis live in India, legally or not, I think the illegal immigrants should be deported from India, regardless of nationality. Even though I respect the people of different countries, I still believe national security matters, and it is our duty to make sure the law of the land is adhered properly. At the same time, I urge the governments of the immigrants' countries to take care of those people in their countries, so that they avoid taking measures that are considered illegal in relevant jurisdictions.</p>
			<!-- Pakistan-->
			<h4 class="font-bold m-1 text-lg">Pakistan: A Rare Empathy towards an Islamic Nation</h4>
			<p>In May 2025, after the Pahalgam terror attack and during India's Operation Sindoor in Pakistan, I looked at a map of Pakistan, originally to analyse the different languages of the country. Bizarrely, the map started looking like a bird to me. Not a hostile shape, but something alive. In contrast, people like Khan Sir see a dog in that same map — and it makes me realize how deeply personal and subjective geopolitical symbols can be.</p>
			<p>During the Operation Sindoor, I noticed how both India and Pakistan twist narratives during conflict, and how quickly misinformation spreads. I heard Pakistan receiving $1 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 11 May, and we were quick to point out that it was nothing to Indian billionaires like Mukesh Ambani. Yes, $1 billion might be nothing to billionaires, but things like international aid are serious matters affecting millions of ordinary men, most of whom have no control over state policies or military decisions. Countries like Pakistan have done nothing wrong to ask for loan or "bheekh" when the people are at stake. Same goes to Palestine, Syria, and many other war-torn countries.</p>
			<!-- duality -->
			<h3 class="font-bold m-1 text-xl">Between Two Bengals, Two Kashmirs, Two Punjabs</h3>
			<p>I often think about "Epar Bangla Opar Bangla"; Bangladesh at one side, West Bengal at the other. I also think about the Kashmir region divided by two countries, and the two Punjabs at both sides of the Radcliffe Line. So many regions share roots, languages, and music — yet remain torn apart by invisible lines and visible pain.</p>
			<p>I once thought these regions might reunite politically one day, forming the so-called "Akhand Bharat" or united India. However, I now understand that political unification may never come. Maybe in the near future, people in those regions will evolve separately with their unique identities, shaped by different governments, stories, and borders.</p>
			<!-- empathy -->
			<h3 class="font-bold m-1 text-xl">Empathy Is Not Agreement</h3>
			<p>Let me be clear: I am not pro-neighbour. I'm not anti-India, either. I still believe national security matters; I still think terrorism is real; and I still know that politics is complex. But I have come to realize that empathy is not betrayal.</p>
			<p>You can express empathy for ordinary people in neighbouring countries without endorsing their governments. You can feel sorrow for both sides in a conflict. You can dream of cultural unity even when political unity feels impossible. You can say the Partition of India was a tragedy — not to erase the past, but to mourn what could have been.</p>
			<!-- empathy 2 -->
			<h3 class="font-bold m-1 text-xl">I Don't Need a Visa to Empathize</h3>
			<p>Maybe I'll never set foot in Chattogram, Dhaka, Karachi, or Lahore. Maybe diplomatic walls will always exist. But at least in my mind, those places are no longer forbidden. They are not just "enemy territories"; they are homes to people who love their families, speak their truths, write poetry, share memes, and grieve the same way I do. And the shift from viewing countries as "enemies" to viewing people as humans has changed me in a way no right-wing group ever could.</p>
			<!-- conclusion -->
			<h3 class="font-bold m-1 text-xl">Conclusion</h3>
			<p>I conclude this blog with a simple statement,</p>
			<p class="font-bold text-center">To hate is easy. To unlearn hate, that's the real revolution.</p>
